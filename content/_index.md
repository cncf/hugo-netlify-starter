This is *not* a full-fledged Hugo theme! It's just a convenient way to get started with a brand new site that's wired with:

* A [Netlify](https://netlify.com) configuration for easy deployment, plus deploy previews
* Some baseline [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) scaffolding
* The [Bootstrap 4.5.x](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) CSS framework
* An example Hugo configuration with:
  * A main menu
  * Specified sans-serif and monospace fonts
  * Some extra colors
  * A Twitter button
  * Some copyright text for the footer
